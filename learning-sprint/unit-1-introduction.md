# Course assignment

During the conception phase, you must decide on the **software devellopment methodology** that you will follow in the devellopment phase. Briefly explain your choice. Note that depending on the chosen methodology, stages and roles in the project vary.

**The first step is to create a written "project profile"** for your software engineering project. it includes the objectives and the scope of the project, your target group, the risks associated with the project, a project plan, and the project organization. in companies, such a project profile is typically required as input for the decision on its funding. Due to the scope of this course, it is not necessary to calculate the complete business case.
