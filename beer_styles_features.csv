Additional notes,"These are any traditional or experimental style of lager, ale or hybrid beer aged in either a wooden barrel or in contact with wood chips, spirals, strips or many other formats. These beers are aged with the intention of developing unique attributes imparted by the wood, or liquids that had previously been stored in contact with the wood. Wood-aging does not necessarily impart wood flavors, but does result in distinctive sensory outcomes. Used sherry, rum, whiskey, tequila, port, wine, and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to a beer. A balance of flavor, aroma, and mouthfeel results from the marriage of new beer with attributes imparted by the wood or barrel. Categorizing these beers can be complex. Sour versions which do not exhibit attributes typical of Brettanomyces are categorized as Wood-Aged Sour Beer. Wood-Aged Beers which exhibit sensory attributes typical of Brettanomyces alone, or of Brettanomyces and other microbes, are categorized as Brett Beer or Mixed-Culture Brett Beer respectively. Wood-aged versions of various classic India Pale Ales are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ale. Belgian-style ales that exhibit attributes of wood-aging are categorized as Other Belgian Ale or within other Belgian categories. Various fruited Belgian-style beers that exhibit attributes of wood-aging are categorized as BelgianStyle Fruit Beer; similarly, Saison aged in wood and"

Color,Can range from pale to black depending on underlying beer style and is often influenced by the color of added fruit
Clarity,"Chill haze, bacteria, and yeast-induced haze is acceptable at any temperature."
Perceived Malt Aroma & Flavor,"Low. In darker versions, any of roasted malt, caramel, or chocolate aroma and flavor attributes should be present at low levels."
Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor,None to high
Perceived Bitterness,None to high and in balance with fruit character
Fermentation Characteristics,"Moderate to intense, yet balanced, fruity esters are present. Diacetyl, DMS, and Brettanomyces should not be present. The evolution of natural acidity at medium-low to high levels develops a balanced complexity and is expressed as a refreshing, pleasant sourness, in harmony with other attributes. The acidity present is usually in the form of lactic, acetic, and other organic acids naturally developed with acidiﬁed malt in the mash or in kettle or post wort fermentation and is produced by various microorganisms, including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and attributes of age. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived ﬂavors such as vanillin should not be present. Attributes arising from liquids previously aged in a barrel, such as bourbon or sherry, should not be present."
Body,Low to high
Additional notes,"Fruit aromas, ranging from subtle to intense, should be present. Fruit or fruit extracts, used as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, provide harmonious fruit character ranging from subtle to intense. Beers exhibiting wood-derived attributes or evidence of liquids previously aged in wood are categorized as Fruited Wood-Aged Sour Beer. Within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is deﬁned as a vegetable, and beers containing coconut are categorized as Field Beer. Likewise beers containing chili peppers are categorized as Chili Beer. Fruited versions of Berliner-Style Weisse and Belgian-Style Sour Ale are categorized elsewhere.

Additional notes,"Beers in this category recognize the uniqueness and traditions of Belgian brewing, but do not hew to any other Belgian-style categories defined in these guidelines. The most notable characteristic that these beers share is a modest alcohol content ranging from 2.1% – 5% abv. These beers can be lower gravity formulations of their own, or can be produced from second run wort from the production of higher gravity beers. Balance is a key component when assessing these beers. Wood-aged or fruited versions will exhibit attributes of wood-aging or fruit(s) in harmony with overall flavor profile. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include an underlying Belgian beer style not otherwise defined in these guidelines or other information unique to the entry such as ingredients (fruit(s), etc.) or processing (wood-aging, etc.) which influence perceived sensory outcomes."

Additional notes,"This category includes beers of any style that 1) are at or below 5.0% abv (4.0% abw) and 2) have an original gravity and alcohol content below the range of the classic style as defined in these guidelines. These beers exhibit lower original gravity and alcohol content than the classic style. Balance and drinkability are key to a successful session beer. A beer at or below 5.0% abv (4% abw) that adheres to the specifications of a classic style is not categorized as Session Beer. For example, low gravity beers such as Belgian-Style Table Beers, Belgian-Style Session Ales, or English-Style Mild Ales should be categorized within their appropriate categories. A beer below 0.5% abv (0.4% abw) is categorized as a Non-Alcohol Malt Beverage. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, organizers may wish to further subcategorize this category. Competition organizers may request that brewers provide actual percent alcohol by volume (abv) for their entries in this category."

Fermentation Characteristics,"American-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional German, British or American ale or lager yeast. Beers fermented with Belgian-style, German-style Hefeweizen or other South German wheat beer or Berliner-style Weisse yeasts should be categorized elsewhere. Fruit beers exhibiting sourness should be categorized elsewhere. Attributes typical of wild fermentation should not be present."
Body,Varies with style
Additional notes,"Fruit aromas, ranging from subtle to intense, should be present and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Fruit or fruit extracts, used as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, provide harmonious fruit character ranging from subtle to intense. Within the framework of these guidelines, fruit beers fermented with Belgian yeast (Wit, Abbey, Farmhouse, Saison, or Brettanomyces) should be categorized as Belgian-Style Fruit Beers, or possibly as fruited Brett Beers. Some beers may fit into this category if they contain fruity adjuncts but no actual fruit. As an example, a juniper berry-ﬂavored beer with notable juniper berry fruity ﬂavor or aroma would be categorized as a Fruit Beer, whereas a beer in which the juniper berry character is more herbal or spicy would be categorized as an Herb and Spice Beer. Fruit Beers brewed with more than 30% wheat are categorized as Fruit Wheat Beers. Fruit Beers brewed with unusual fermentable(s), but no wheat, should be categorized as Fruit Beers. All of the various India Pale Ale or Imperial India Pale Ale styles brewed as Fruit Beers are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ales. All fruited Sour Beers are categorized elsewhere. All fruited Wood- and Barrel-Aged beers whether sour or not are categorized elsewhere. Within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is deﬁned as a vegetable, and a beer containing coconut is categorized as Field Beer. Likewise beers containing chili peppers are categorized as Chili Beer. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as fruit(s) used or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes."

Fermentation Characteristics,"These beers can be fermented with either ale or lager yeast depending on the underlying wheat beer style. Low fruity esters are typical. Diacetyl should not be present. In versions served with yeast, yeasty aroma and ﬂavor should be low to medium."
Body,Low to medium
Additional notes,"The grist should include at least 30 percent malted wheat. Fruit or fruit extracts contribute aroma and ﬂavor expressing true fruit complexity. Versions served with yeast should demonstrate a full yeasty mouthfeel. Fruited examples of wheat beer styles that are not commonly brewed with fruit and do not exhibit attributes of wood-aging should be categorized as Fruit Wheat Beers. These could include fruited versions of various wheat beer styles of European origin such as Weizens, Adambier or Grodziskie. Fruited wheat beers that exhibit sourness fall within various fruited sour beer categories. Such beers could deviate from parameters shown for those styles but should be suggestive of the underlying classic beer style with fruit added. Fruited versions of Berliner Weisse or Contemporary Gose fall within those categories as they are commonly brewed with fruit. Within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is deﬁned as a vegetable, and a beer containing coconut is categorized as Field Beer. Likewise beers containing chili peppers are categorized as Chili Beer. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries.

Additional notes,"Fruit aromas, ranging from subtle to intense, should be present and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Belgian-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional Belgian yeast, (Wit, Abbey, Farmhouse, etc.). Fruit or fruit extracts, used as adjuncts in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, provide harmonious fruit character ranging from subtle to intense. Classifying these beers can be complex. Within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is deﬁned as a vegetable, and a beer containing coconut is categorized as Field Beer. Likewise a beer containing chili peppers is categorized as Chili Beer. Because wood vessels may be used for fermentation or aging, attributes typical of wood-aging such as vanillin, or from liquids previously aged in wood may be present. Fruited Belgian-style beers which exhibit Brettanomyces may be categorized in this style. However, a fruited Saison exhibiting Brett character should be categorized as a Specialty Saison. A fruited version of a Brett Beer is categorized as Fruited Brett Beer when such a Brett-containing beer is not based on an existing underlying Belgian beer style. A Lambic-Style fruit beer should be categorized as a Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic. Fruited Belgian-Style beers brewed with additional adjuncts could fall in this category or perhaps as Experimental Beers. Fruit beers fermented with German, British or American ale or lager yeast should be categorized as American-Style Fruit Beers or as Fruit Wheat Beers. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as fruit(s) used or processing (wood-aging for example) which influence perceived sensory outcomes."

Additional notes,"Vegetable aromas, ranging from subtle to intense, should be present and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Field Beers are any beers incorporating vegetables as ﬂavor or carbohydrate adjuncts in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation. The vegetable character should be in harmony with other attributes and can range from subtle to intense. Within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is deﬁned as a vegetable, and a beer containing coconut is categorized as Field Beer. However, within the framework of these guidelines, India Pale Ales brewed with vegetables are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ale. All beers containing chili peppers are categorized as Chili Beer. Nuts generally impart much more ﬂavor than fermentables; within the framework of these guidelines, beers containing nuts are categorized as Field Beer. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries.

Pumpkin or squash may not be present or may range from subtle to intense. They are spiced with other ingredients whose character should be present and in balance. While cinnamon, allspice, clove, and nutmeg are common spices added to American-type pumpkin beers, other spices may be used. For example, a brewer could replicate a Wit-Pumpkin spiced beer by using orange peel and coriander.

Additional notes,"These are any traditional or experimental style of lager, ale or hybrid beer aged in either a wooden barrel or in contact with wood, and exhibiting acidity derived from exposure to bacteria. These beers are aged in the presence of microflora (either present in the wood or introduced at some time in the brewing process) with the intention of introducing sourness to the beer. These beers are aged with the intention of developing unique attributes imparted by the wood, or by liquids that had previously been stored in contact with the wood. Wood-aging does not necessarily impart wood ﬂavors but does result in distinctive sensory outcomes. Used sherry, rum, whiskey, tequila, port, wine, and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to a beer. A balance of aroma, ﬂavor, and mouthfeel results from the marriage of new beer with attributes imparted by the wood or barrel, and with sourness or other attributes derived from bacteria. Wood-Aged Sour Beer fermented with Brettanomyces or which exhibit sensory attributes typical of Brettanomyces is categorized elsewhere. Such beers made with combinations of fruit(s), herb(s) or spice(s), or other ingredients, and which therefore represent combinations of multiple hybrid beer styles, are categorized as Experimental Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer. Versions made with fruit(s) will exhibit attributes of wood-aging, acidity, and those added fruit(s). Competition organizers may choose to create subcategories for Wood-aged sour beers made with fruit or other ingredients. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as length of time aged, type of wood or barrel, age, char level or previous liquids held by the wood, micro flora present if known, other ingredients or other processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes."

Fermentation Characteristics,"Aged Beers are any beers aged for over one year. A brewer may brew any type of beer of any strength and enhance its character with various aging conditions for an extended time. In general, beers with high hopping rates, roast malt, high alcohol content, and complex herbal, smoke or fruit character are the best candidates for aging. Aged Beers may be aged in bottles, cans, kegs or other non-wooden vessels. Aged character may be expressed in mouthfeel, aroma, and ﬂavor. Often, aged character is the result of oxidative reactions that either bring individual flavor components into harmony or are unique flavors unto themselves. Sherry-like and fruity flavors often develop during aging, and hop character often changes. No matter what the effect, the overall character should be balanced and without aggressive flavors. The level of change created by aging will vary with the duration of aging and the underlying beer style. Mildly-ﬂavored beers are more likely to develop aggressive and unpleasant oxidation. Positive transformations are more likely to occur in beers with higher levels of hops, malt, or alcohol."
Body,Varies with underlying style
Additional notes,"Within the framework of these guidelines, various Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beers which subsequently undergo aging of one or more years in glass or stainless, and, which clearly exhibit sensory outcomes of that additional aging, may be categorized as Aged Beers. However, Brett Beers, Sour Beers or any other beers exhibiting attributes of aging in the presence of any microflora must be categorized elsewhere. Beers which have undergone aging, but which do not exhibit attributes typical of aging, are categorized within their base styles. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as length of time aged, type of vessel, duration of aging process, other ingredients or other processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes."

Additional notes,"Experimental beers are beers that 1. employ unique and unusual techniques, ingredients, or both; or 2. beers that do not meet the criteria of individual existing categories, representing a combination of two or more hybrid, specialty or classic categories (with the exception of beers brewed with chili peppers). Experimental beers are primarily grain-based with a minimum of 51% of fermentable carbohydrates derived from malted grains. Beers produced using non-experimental techniques or ingredients are considered experimental beers if their properties overlap two or more existing categories and exhibit the distinctive characteristics of each of those categories. Uniqueness is the primary consideration when evaluating this category. Within the framework of these guidelines, ﬁeld, fruit, chocolate, coffee, spice, specialty, wood-aged or other beers that fit within another individual hybrid category are not categorized as experimental beers. Within the framework of these guidelines, all beers brewed with chili peppers are categorized as chili beers, and should not be categorized as experimental beers. Within the framework of these guidelines, experimental beers which otherwise meet the criteria of various India Pale Ale and Imperial India Pale Ale categories from around the world are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ale. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include an underlying beer style(s) upon which the entry is based (if such style(s) is apparent), or other information unique to the entry such as ingredients or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes.

Additional notes,"Beers in this category recognize the cutting edge of IPA brewing around the world. Experimental India Pale Ales are either 1) any of White, Red, Brown, Brut (fermented with champagne yeasts), Brett (fermented with Brettanomyces), Lager (fermented with lager yeasts), or many other IPA or Imperial IPA types or combinations thereof currently in production, and fruited or spiced versions of these, or 2) fruited, spiced, field (flavored with vegetables other than chili peppers), wood- and barrel-aged, or other elaborated versions of classic American, Juicy or Hazy, Imperial, British, or any other IPA categories. They range widely in color, hop, and malt intensity and attributes, hop bitterness, balance, alcohol content, body, and overall flavor experience. Dark versions of India Pale Ale that do not meet the specifications for American-Style Black Ale may be considered Experimental India Pale Ale. Fruited and spiced versions exhibit attributes typical of those ingredients, in harmony with hop impression and overall flavor experience. Lactose may be used to enhance body and balance, but should not lend to, or overwhelm, the flavor character of these beers. Classifying these beers can be complex. India Pale Ales brewed with honey are categorized here. Spiced or fruited versions of these beers, or those made with unusual fermentables or honey, are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ale. India Pale Ales flavored with nuts, coconut or other vegetables are categorized here rather than as Field Beers. However, within the framework of these guidelines, all beers brewed with chili peppers are categorized as Chili Beers; India Pale Ale brewed w/ chili peppers in any form are categorized as Chili Beer. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries.

Additional notes,"Any style of beer can be smoked. The goal is to reach a balance between the style’s character and the smoky properties. Any smoke beer that does not fit other smoke beer categories are appropriately categorized here. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style(s), or other information unique to the entry such as type of wood smoke or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes."

Fermentation Characteristics,"Within the framework of these guidelines, beers of any style intentionally brewed to a higher alcohol content than defined within that style’s guidelines are categorized as Other Strong Beer. These beers should achieve a balance between the style’s characteristics and the additional alcohol, and are not wood- or barrel-aged. All Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beers that meet the criteria for elevated alcohol content shown below are categorized as any of several Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beers."

Additional notes,"This category includes lagers, ales or other beers made from fermentable sugars, grains and converted carbohydrates and must also include some portion of cereal. All ingredients must be free of gluten. Within the framework of these guidelines, beers brewed with barley, wheat, spelt, rye, and other gluten-containing ingredients may not be categorized as Gluten-Free. Gluten-Free Beers may contain malted grains that are gluten-free. NOTE: These guidelines do not supersede any government regulations. Wine, mead, ﬂavored malt beverages or beverages other than ‘beer’ as deﬁned by the TTB (U.S. Trade and Tax Bureau) are not considered ‘gluten-free beer’ under these guidelines. Gluten-reduced beers’ original ingredients would have gluten content that has been reduced by enzymes or other processes to reduced levels. Gluten-reduced beers should be categorized in the classic style category most appropriate for the beer, rather than as Gluten-Free Beer. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include an underlying beer style if appropriate, gluten-free grains or other carbohydrate sources, or other information unique to the entry such as ingredients or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes such as microflora, fruit, spices, other ingredients, wood-aging, etc."

Fermentation Characteristics,"Non-alcohol (N/A) malt beverages can emulate the character of any beer style defined within these guidelines but with no or nearly no alcohol (less than 0.5 percent abv). Ethyl acetate should not be present. Due to their nature, non-alcohol malt beverages will have a proﬁle lacking the complexity and balance of ﬂavors that beers containing alcohol will display. N/A beers should be assessed with this is mind, and should not be given negative evaluations for reasons related to the absence of alcohol."

Additional notes,"Beers in this category build on a strong dark beer base and incorporate culinary ingredients to create rich, sweet flavor profiles mimicking the character of desserts, pastries or candies. Examples of culinary ingredients used in these beers include, but are not limited to, chocolate, coffee, coconut, vanilla, maple syrup, peanut butter and marshmallow as well as fruits, nuts and spices. The addition of sugars from any source may contribute to the pronounced sweetness of these beers. While this category may overlap several other styles defined in these guidelines such as Chocolate or Cocoa Beers, Coffee Beers, Field beers, and others, the combination of a dark beer base, elevated alcohol content and rich, sweet, dessert-like flavor profiles sets this style apart as a unique entity."
