# HoppyBrew Concept Documentation

## Introduction

HoppyBrew stands as a dedicated web application crafted for brewing enthusiasts and homebrewers, specifically designed for self-hosting. Drawing inspiration from [Brewfather](https://brewfather.app/), it operates seamlessly within a Docker container and comes with no associated costs. Developed as part of the Software Engineering course at the Faculty of Informatics, International University of Applied Sciences Bad Honnef - Bonn, HoppyBrew addresses the critical need for streamlined management of brewing processes.

Born from the personal journey of the creator as a homebrewer venturing into self-hosting, HoppyBrew aims to be a bespoke solution. This web application empowers users to independently create, share, and manage their beer recipes, eliminating any dependence on subscription-based services like Brewfather.

What sets HoppyBrew apart is its self-hosted architecture within a Docker container, providing users with easy account creation, login, and seamless control over recipe-related tasks such as creation, editing, and deletion. The application also boasts a user-friendly search function for recipes based on name, style, or ingredients.

Moving beyond mere recipe management, HoppyBrew integrates seamlessly with iSpindel over Ethernet, allowing users to actively monitor and track the fermentation process. It further aids users in keeping a meticulous record of their brewing inventory and generates shopping lists based on selected recipes, thereby elevating the overall brewing experience for users.

### Objective and scope of the project

The primary objective of HoppyBrew is to develop a web application tailored for homebrewers, aiding them in efficiently managing their brewing processes. The application is designed to be self-hosted, eliminating the need for subscription-based services. The scope of the project encompasses the following key features:

- User account creation and login
- Recipe management: creation, editing, and deletion
- Recipe search based on name, style, or ingredients
- Batch creation and management
- Batch tracking and monitoring during the brewing process
- Integration with iSpindel over Ethernet for fermentation process monitoring
- Inventory management
- Shopping list generation based on selected recipes
- User-friendly interface
- Docker container architecture

### Target audience

The target audience for HoppyBrew includes homebrewers and brewing enthusiasts seeking a self-hosted solution for managing their brewing processes. The application is designed to cater to users who wish to create, share, and manage their beer recipes independently, without relying on subscription-based services.

### Risk associated with the project

The risks associated with the project include:

- Technical challenges in integrating iSpindel over Ethernet
- Using Angular* for the first time, which may lead to a learning curve.
- Ensuring seamless integration of the Docker container architecture
- CI/CD pipeline setup and maintenance for the project

**Note!** We have many options for building the frontend of our project, but it seems like Angular or React are the most popular choices. Our team doesn't have experience with either of them. After some research, we found out that while React is easier to pick up, Angular is more powerful and performs better. Also, Angular developers tend to earn more than React developers based on information from Glassdoor. Therefore, we've decided to use Angular for our project.

## Software development methodology

The project will follow the Agile methodology, with a focus on iterative development and continuous feedback. The Agile approach will enable the team to adapt to changing requirements and deliver a high-quality product that meets user expectations.
