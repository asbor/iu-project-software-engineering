# HoppyBrew documentation

## Introduction

HoppyBrew is a self-hosted web application designed for brewing enthusiasts and homebrewers. Inspired by [Brewfather](https://brewfather.app/), it operates within a Docker container and is offered free of charge. Developed as part of the Software Engineering course at the Faculty of Informatics, International University of Applied Sciences Bad Honnef - Bonn, HoppyBrew caters to those seeking efficient management of their brewing processes.

Motivated by the creator's personal experience as a homebrewer exploring self-hosting, this project aims to provide a tailored solution. The web application enables users to create, share, and manage their beer recipes independently, eliminating the need for subscription-based services like Brewfather.

Distinct from existing alternatives, HoppyBrew fills a niche by offering a self-hosted solution running in a Docker container. Users can create accounts, log in, and seamlessly handle recipe-related tasks, including creation, editing, and deletion. Additionally, the application features a search function for recipes by name, style, or ingredients.

Going beyond recipe management, HoppyBrew integrates with iSpindel over Ethernet, allowing users to monitor and track the fermentation process. The application also assists users in keeping track of their brewing inventory and generates shopping lists based on selected recipes, enhancing the overall brewing experience.
