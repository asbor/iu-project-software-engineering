# Project Documentation Outline

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background

HoppyBrew is a web application tailored for brewing enthusiasts and homebrewers, designed for self-hosting. Developed as part of the Software Engineering course at the Faculty of Informatics, International University of Applied Sciences Bad Honnef - Bonn, HoppyBrew addresses the critical need for streamlined management of brewing processes.

Crafted from the personal journey of the creator as a homebrewer venturing into self-hosting, HoppyBrew aims to be a bespoke solution. This web application empowers users to independently create, share, and manage their beer recipes, eliminating any dependence on subscription-based services like Brewfather.

What sets HoppyBrew apart is its self-hosted architecture within a Docker container, providing users with easy account creation, login, and seamless control over recipe-related tasks such as creation, editing, and deletion. The application also boasts a user-friendly search function for recipes based on name, style, or ingredients.

Beyond recipe management, HoppyBrew integrates seamlessly with iSpindel over Ethernet, allowing users to actively monitor and track the fermentation process. It further aids users in keeping a meticulous record of their brewing inventory and generates shopping lists based on selected recipes, thereby elevating the overall brewing experience for users.

# 2. Project Overview

## 2.1 Purpose

The purpose of the project is to develop a web application that caters to the needs of brewing enthusiasts and homebrewers, with a specific focus on self-hosting.
