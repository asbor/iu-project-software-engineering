# Project Documentation Outline

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background

Welcome to the world of HoppyBrew, a purpose-built web application tailored for brewing enthusiasts and homebrewers with a unique focus on self-hosting. Born out of the creator's personal journey into the realms of homebrewing and self-hosting, HoppyBrew has emerged as a distinct solution to address the challenges faced in managing brewing processes efficiently.

### 1.1.1 Inception

HoppyBrew finds its roots in the Software Engineering course at the Faculty of Informatics, International University of Applied Sciences Bad Honnef - Bonn. Inspired by notable platforms like [Brewfather](https://brewfather.app/) and [Beersmith](https://beersmith.com/), this web application operates seamlessly within a Docker container and incurs no associated costs.

### 1.1.2 Purpose and Vision

At its core, HoppyBrew aims to provide brewing enthusiasts with a bespoke solution for independent creation, sharing, and management of beer recipes. The primary objective is to eliminate reliance on subscription-based services, offering users the freedom to control their brewing experiences.

### 1.1.3 Unique Features

What sets HoppyBrew apart is its self-hosted architecture within a Docker container. Users benefit from straightforward account creation, login procedures, and effortless control over recipe-related tasks such as creation, editing, and deletion. The application boasts a user-friendly search function enabling users to discover recipes based on name, style, or ingredients.

### 1.1.4 Beyond Recipe Management

HoppyBrew transcends conventional recipe management by seamlessly integrating with iSpindel over Ethernet. This integration empowers users to actively monitor and track the fermentation process, providing real-time insights. Additionally, the application assists users in maintaining a meticulous inventory of brewing supplies and generates shopping lists based on selected recipes, enhancing the overall brewing experience.

Join us on this brewing journey with HoppyBrew, where innovation meets tradition, and the art of crafting the perfect brew is at your fingertips. Cheers to a new era of homebrewing!
