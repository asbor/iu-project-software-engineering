# 1. Introduction

This project is part of the Software Engineering course at the Faculty of Informatics, International University of Applied Sciences Bad Honnef - Bonn. It draws inspiration from an existing project called [Brewfather](https://brewfather.app/). The primary objective is to develop a web application tailored for home-brewers, aiding them in efficiently managing their brewing processes.

The motivation behind choosing this project stems from personal experience, as the creator is a homebrewer seeking a self-hosted solution. Having ventured into self-hosting as a hobby, there is a desire to craft a web application specifically designed for managing the brewing process. The intention is to host this application on a personal server, avoiding reliance on subscription-based services such as Brewfather.

While several applications with similar functionalities already exist, this project aims to fulfill a specific niche by providing a self-hosted solution running within a Docker container.
