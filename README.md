    This project, part of the Software Engineering course at the Faculty of Informatics, International University of Applied Sciences Bad Honnef - Bonn, is inspired by Brewfather. It aims to develop a web app tailored for home-brewers to efficiently manage brewing processes. Motivated by personal experience as a homebrewer and interest in self-hosting, the creator seeks to provide a self-hosted alternative to subscription-based services like Brewfather. The project will be hosted on a personal server, running within a Docker container, to cater to a specific niche in brewing management.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![HoppyBrew](images/Brewmaster.webp)

The project, undertaken as part of the Software Engineering course at the Faculty of Informatics, International University of Applied Sciences Bad Honnef - Bonn, seeks to develop a web application tailored for home-brewers. Inspired by the existing project Brewfather, the objective is to create a platform that assists brewers in efficiently managing their brewing processes. The project is motivated by personal experience, with the creator being a homebrewer looking for a self-hosted solution. By leveraging Docker containers, the aim is to provide a self-hosted alternative to subscription-based services like Brewfather, catering to a specific niche within the brewing community.
