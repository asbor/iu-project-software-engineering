Hello **Asbjorn**,

thank you for your first submission and also for your active participation in the online sessions!

Here some comments from my side:

You explained and presented your **project goals**, the **stakeholders** and the **benefits** very well and convincingly.

You have chosen the **project risks** well. Please add suitable **mitigation strategies** to each of these.

The **software development process** is appropriate to the project. Please provide some more details regarding your **sprint planning** in the course of this project (at latest for the final submission).

You have already specified the **functional requirements** very nicely and in detail.

You could be a little more specific with the **non-functional requirements**. Try to formulate the requirements in such a way that their degree of fulfillment can be measured. For example, use concrete figures for aspects such as **scalability** or **reliability**. It is very good that you have taken up some of the **quality objectives** again in section 4.2 and explicitly presented solutions!

The **constraints and conventions** as well as **dependencies on external services** are very well described. You have also described and illustrated the **business context** and **use cases** very well! The **sequence diagram** is also a good addition. It seems that **pages 15-18** are already included in the document. The content also seems to be repeated later on at some places. You have specified the **runtime view** and the **deployment view** very well. Overall, you have already specified your **architecture** in great detail, comprehensibly and very well!

Overall, you have explained the key **technical** and **organizational decisions** very well and comprehensibly.

It would be good if you could explain a few more **beer brewing terms** in the **glossary**.

The **file name** does not comply with the specifications defined in section 4.2 of the course assignment. Please check this and take it into account for the upcoming submissions.

You can continue with the next phase now. You are on a very good way.

I wish you a lot of fun and success with your project!

And in case of any questions or need for discussion please don't hesitate to contact me via the known Teams channels or by joining one of the upcoming live sessions.

Best regards,

**Holger**
