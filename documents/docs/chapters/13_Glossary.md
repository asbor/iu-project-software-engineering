## Conclusion

In conclusion, the development of HoppyBrew has been a challenging yet rewarding journey. Despite not implementing the iSpindel integration due to its complexity and the testing constraints, the project achieved several key milestones and functional implementations.

### Achievements

1. **Database and Models:** Successfully created the database, including the models and CMS, which start up correctly. This setup involved ensuring smooth communication between the three Docker containers for the backend, database, and frontend.
2. **CRUD Operations:** Implemented and tested CRUD operations for hops, fermentables, miscellaneous items, yeast, recipes, and batches.
3. **Web Scraping:** Conducted web scraping to pull down various recipes, including those from the Brewer Association, and successfully stored this data in the database.
4. **Import and Export of XML Files:** Implemented functionalities to import and export BeerXML files, allowing seamless data exchange with applications like Brewfather.
5. **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):** Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, successfully building and testing Docker containers, and ensuring interconnectedness between containers. This setup also included linting for code quality and partial implementation of deployment processes to Docker Hub.
6. **Documentation:** Developed comprehensive documentation using Markdown, converted to PDF using Pandoc. Despite the technical challenges, this documentation ensures clarity and ease of understanding for future developers.
7. **Makefile:** Worked with makefiles to streamline and automate the build process, which proved to be a powerful tool for managing project build tasks efficiently.

### Challenges

1. **Dependency and Version Control:** Faced significant issues with managing dependencies and version control due to discrepancies between different tutorials and updates, leading to frequent application breaks and fixes.
2. **Database Migration:** Encountered extensive challenges with database relationships and migrations, which would have benefited from earlier use of database versioning tools.
3. **Front-end Development:** Although new to Vue.js and Nuxt.js, managed to develop the frontend, despite occasional breaks and the need to frequently rebuild the virtual environment.
4. **Complex Implementations:** Left out complex features such as equipment profiles, water profiles, and mash profiles due to time constraints and their similarity to recipe CRUD operations.
5. **Docker and Docker Compose:** Spent considerable time working with Docker and Docker Compose, realizing their differences. Docker Compose, while useful for local development, was not recommended for the Unraid system, leading to additional complexity in deployment strategies.

### Learnings

1. **Scrum Methodology:** Gained a deep appreciation for Scrum, finding its dynamic and agile approach highly effective.
2. **Tools and Technologies:** Learned to use Atlassian Jira for project management, Docker for containerization, FastAPI for backend development, and Vue.js/Nuxt.js for frontend development.
3. **Documentation Practices:** Invested time in building thorough documentation, learning the intricacies of Markdown and conversion tools like Pandoc.
4. **GitHub vs. GitLab:** Initially explored using GitLab for its strong CI/CD capabilities but realized late in the project that the assignment required using GitHub. Upon reflection, found GitHub to be stronger and easier to work with, facilitating smoother project management and CI/CD implementation.
5. **Makefile:** Utilized makefiles to automate build tasks, enhancing the efficiency and manageability of the projectâ€™s build process.

Overall, the HoppyBrew project provided a comprehensive learning experience, equipping me with valuable skills and knowledge in modern web application development and project management methodologies. Despite some unfinished features and the decision to deprioritize certain functionalities, the project stands as a robust proof of concept, ready for further development and refinement.
