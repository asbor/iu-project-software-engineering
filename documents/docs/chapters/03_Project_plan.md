# Project plan

For this 5-credit school project, we've allotted 150 hours, assuming 1 credit equals 30 hours. We're dividing it into five 40-hour sprints, using Atlassian Jira and a Kanban board for task management.

Due to disruptions, we're aligning progress with hours rather than fixed dates. Despite exceeding estimated time in the first two sprints, setting up Atlassian Jira will help us track time more accurately going forward. We'll add one more sprint to make up for lost time, bringing the total sprints to five.

## Software Development Methodology

We're following an agile development process, using the Scrum framework with one-week sprints. Git is our version control system, hosted on GitLab for collaboration and code maintenance.

## Timeline

The project consists of three major phases:

1. **Conception Phase:** Defining objectives, scope, methodology, and requirements. Lasts two weeks.
2. **Development Phase:** Building the application, testing, deployment, and documentation. Lasts six weeks.
3. **Conclusion Phase:** Evaluating the project, preparing the final report, and presentation. Lasts two weeks.

These phases represent major milestones, though not explicitly depicted in the timeline image below. The sprints align with these milestones.
