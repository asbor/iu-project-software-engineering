# Quality Requirements

This section contains all quality requirements in the form of a quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2 (quality goals). Here, we capture additional quality requirements with lesser priority, which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved. Since quality requirements significantly influence architectural decisions, it's essential to understand what is truly important to every stakeholder, both concretely and measurably.

The quality tree, as defined in the ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method), consists of quality/evaluation scenarios as leaves. The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a potentially large number of quality requirements. The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements, structured as a tree-like refinement of the term "quality," with "quality" or "usefulness" as the root and quality categories as main branches. In any case, the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.

## Quality Scenarios

To make quality requirements concrete, we use scenarios that describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system. For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

- Usage scenarios describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance.
  - Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.
- Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or its immediate environment.
  - Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow easier measurement or decision-making on whether they are fulfilled. Especially when assessing your architecture using methods like ATAM, you need to describe your quality goals more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated. Scenarios can be documented in tabular or free-form text.

| **ID** | **Description** | **Stimulus** | **Response Time** | **Priority** |
| - | --- | -- | - | - |
| QS1 | User submits a new brewing recipe | Form submission | <1 second | High |
| QS2 | System integrates real-time data from iSpindel | Data arrival | Immediate | High |
| QS3 | User navigates to the recipe library | Click on menu item | <1 second | Medium |
| QS4 | Admin updates system settings | Form submission | <2 seconds | Medium |
| QS5 | New API integration with external brewing tool | API call | <2 seconds | Low |
| QS6 | System updates with new functionality (e.g., new recipe format support) | Deployment | Smooth transition | Medium |
