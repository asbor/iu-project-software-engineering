# Risks and Technical Debts

A list of identified technical risks or technical debts is provided, ordered by priority. “Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild). This should be the motto for systematic detection and evaluation of risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by management stakeholders (e.g., project managers, product owners) as part of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning. The risks and technical debts are listed along with suggested measures to minimize, mitigate, or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.

| **ID** | **Description** | **Priority** | **Suggested Measures** |
| - | --- | - | --- |
| R1 | Inadequate performance under high load | High | Implement load testing and optimize code efficiency |
| R2 | Security vulnerabilities due to insufficient validation | High | Conduct regular security audits and implement robust validation checks |
| R3 | Technical debt from rapid feature additions | Medium | Allocate regular refactoring sessions |
| R4 | Integration issues with new brewing tools | Medium | Establish comprehensive integration testing protocols |
| R5 | Delays in data updates from iSpindel | Low | Implement buffering and retry mechanisms |
