# Architecture Constraints

## Technical Constraints

| Id | Constraint | Background and / or Motivation |
| - | -- | ---- |
| **TC1** | **Technology Stack** | The application will be developed using a specific technology stack, including Vue.js, Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Docker Compose. This is to ensure consistency and compatibility across different components of the application. |
| **TC2** | **Open-source** | The application will be open-source, with a permissive license. This is to ensure that the application is freely available and can be used and modified by anyone. |
| **TC3** | **Compatibility** | The application should be compatible with a wide range of devices and browsers. However, in this project, we will focus on developing the application for desktop browsers. |
| **TC4** | **Integration** | The application should integrate with other brewing tools and services, such as iSpindel. However, in this project, we will focus on integrating with iSpindel only. |
| **TC5** | **Performance** | No aspects related to performance will be considered in this project. |
| **TC6** | **Scalability** | No aspects related to scalability will be considered in this project. |
| **TC7** | **Reliability** | No aspects related to reliability will be considered in this project. |
| **TC8** | **Security** | No aspects related to security will be considered in this project. |
| **TC9** | **Maintainability** | No aspects related to maintainability will be considered in this project. |

## Organizational Constraints

| Id | Constraint | Background and / or Motiqation |
| - | -- | ---- |
| **OC1** | **Deadline** | As a school project, worth 5 credits, a time constraint is imposed on the project. The project is expected to take about 150 hours to complete. |
| **OC2** | **Feature Limitations** | As a school project, some parts of the application will be left out. For example, not every type of action for all the different parts of the app will be implemented. If one type of action can be done for one part, it will be assumed it can be done for all the others. |
| **OC3** | **User Interface Simplification** | To keep things simple, the user interface will be made as basic as possible while still showing how the app works. This means it won't look super fancy or work perfectly on every device, but it'll get the job done. |

## Conventions

The following conventions will be used in the documentation:

| Id | Convention | Background and / or Motivation |
| - | -- | ---- |
| **C1** | **Language** | The documentation will be written inNaming Conventions** | The application will follow a consistent naming convention for variables, functions, and components. This is to ensure that the code is easy to read and understand. | English. This is to ensure that the documentation is accessible to a wide audience. |
| **C2** | **Architecture** | The documentation will follow the arc42 template. This is to ensure that the documentation is well-structured and consistent. |
| **C3** | **Version Control** | The application will use Git for version control. This is to ensure that the codebase is well-maintained and up-to-date. |
| **C4** | **Code Style** | The application will follow a consistent code style, based on the PEP 8 style guide for Python. This is to ensure that the code is clean and readable. |
