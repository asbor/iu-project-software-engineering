# Solution Strategy

## Technology Decisions

The application will be encapsulated in a containerized environment using Docker. The application will be developed using Vue.js as the frontend technology, Python and FastAPI as the backend technology, and PostgreSQL as the database technology. The application will be deployed using Docker and Docker Compose. The development of the application will be done using Visual Studio Code as the primary code editor.

### Frontend Technology

After evaluating the requirements and constraints of the project, we have decided to use Vue.js as the frontend technology for the application. This is because Vue.js is a lightweight and flexible JavaScript framework that allows for rapid development of single-page applications. It provides a simple and intuitive syntax, making it easy to learn and use, which is ideal for a school project with a tight deadline. Additionally, Vue.js has a large and active community, which means there are plenty of resources and support available for developers. This will help us overcome any challenges we may face during the development process.

### Backend Technology

The backend of the application will be developed using Python and FastAPI. FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. It is fast, easy to use, and provides automatic validation and serialization of request and response data. FastAPI is also based on standard Python type hints, which makes it easy to use and understand for developers who are familiar with Python. Additionally, FastAPI has built-in support for asynchronous programming, which allows for greater performance and scalability of the application. This makes it an ideal choice for building the backend of our application.

### Database Technology

The application will use PostgreSQL as the database technology. PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system that is widely used in the industry. It provides a rich set of features, including support for complex queries, transactions, and data integrity constraints. PostgreSQL is also highly scalable and reliable, making it suitable for use in production environments. Additionally, PostgreSQL has excellent support for JSON data types, which will be useful for storing and querying the data in our application. Overall, PostgreSQL is a solid choice for the database technology of our application.

### Deployment Technology

The application will be deployed using Docker and Docker Compose. Docker is a containerization platform that allows applications to be packaged into lightweight, portable containers that can run on any system. Docker Compose is a tool that allows multiple containers to be managed and orchestrated together. This will allow us to easily deploy and scale the application, as well as ensure consistency across different environments. Additionally, Docker and Docker Compose are widely used in the industry, which means there are plenty of resources and support available for developers. This will help us overcome any challenges we may face during the deployment process.

### Development Tools

The development of the application will be done using Visual Studio Code as the primary code editor. Visual Studio Code is a lightweight and powerful code editor that provides a rich set of features, including syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools. It also has a large and active community, which means there are plenty of extensions and support available for developers. This will help us write clean and efficient code, as well as overcome any challenges we may face during the development process.

## Key Quality Goals

The key quality goals of the application are as follows:

1. Performance: The application should be fast and responsive, with low latency and high throughput.
2. Scalability: The application should be able to handle a large number of users and requests, and scale horizontally as needed.
3. Reliability: The application should be highly available and fault-tolerant, with minimal downtime and data loss.

To achieve these quality goals, we will use the following approaches:

1. Performance: We will use FastAPI for the backend, which is a high-performance web framework that is optimized for speed. We will also use PostgreSQL as the database technology, which is highly scalable and reliable. Additionally, we will use Docker and Docker Compose for deployment, which will allow us to easily scale the application as needed.
2. Scalability: We will use a microservices architecture for the application, with each component running as a separate service. This will allow for greater flexibility and scalability, as well as making it easier to maintain and update the application. We will also use Docker and Docker Compose for deployment, which will allow us to easily scale the application as needed.
3. Reliability: We will use PostgreSQL as the database technology, which is highly reliable and provides support for transactions and data integrity constraints. We will also use Docker and Docker Compose for deployment, which will allow us to easily manage and orchestrate multiple containers. Additionally, we will implement automated testing and monitoring to ensure the reliability of the application.

## Organizational Decisions

The application will be developed by a team of four developers, with each developer responsible for a specific component of the application. The team will follow an agile development process, with regular stand-up meetings, sprint planning, and retrospectives. The team will also use Git as the version control system, with a central repository hosted on GitHub. This will allow for easy collaboration and coordination between team members, as well as ensuring that the codebase is well-maintained and up-to-date.

## Motivation

The motivation for the chosen technology decisions is as follows:

1. Frontend Technology: Vue.js was chosen as the frontend technology because of its lightweight and flexible nature, as well as its large and active community. This will help us develop the frontend of the application quickly and efficiently, with plenty of resources and support available.
2. Backend Technology: FastAPI was chosen as the backend technology because of its speed, ease of use, and support for asynchronous programming. This will help us develop the backend of the application quickly and efficiently, with high performance and scalability.
3. Database Technology: PostgreSQL was chosen as the database technology because of its power, scalability, and reliability. This will help us store and query the data in the application efficiently and reliably, with support for complex queries and transactions.
4. Deployment Technology: Docker and Docker Compose were chosen as the deployment technology because of their containerization capabilities and ease of use. This will help us deploy and scale the application easily and consistently, with support for managing and orchestrating multiple containers.
5. Development Tools: Visual Studio Code was chosen as the primary code editor because of its lightweight and powerful nature, as well as its rich set of features and extensions. This will help us write clean and efficient code, with plenty of resources and support available.

## Solution Approaches

The solution approaches for the application are as follows:

1. Frontend: The frontend of the application will be developed using Vue.js, with a focus on simplicity, usability, and responsiveness. The frontend will communicate with the backend using RESTful APIs, with support for real-time updates and notifications.

2. Backend: The backend of the application will be developed using Python and FastAPI, with a focus on speed, performance, and scalability. The backend will provide a set of APIs for the frontend to interact with, with support for authentication, authorization, and validation.
3. Database: The database of the application will be developed using PostgreSQL, with a focus on reliability, scalability, and data integrity. The database will store the data in a structured and efficient manner, with support for complex queries and transactions.
4. Deployment: The application will be deployed using Docker and Docker Compose, with a focus on consistency, scalability, and reliability. The application will be packaged into lightweight and portable containers, which can run on any system.
