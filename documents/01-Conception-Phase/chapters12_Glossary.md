| **Term**         | **Definition**         |
| - | ---- |
| **Actor** | in use case parlance, are parties outside the system that interact with the system. They may be users or other systems. Each actor defines a coherent set of roles users of the system can play (UML, 1999). Cockburn (1997) distinguishes between primary and secondary actors. A primary actor is one having a goal requiring the assistance of the system. A secondary actor is one from which the system needs assistance to satisfy its goal. |
| **Architecture** | The term software architecture is used both to refer to the high-level structure of software systems and the specialist discipline or field distinct from that of software engineering. The architecture of a software system identifies a set of components that collaborate to achieve the system goals. The architecture specifies the “externally visible” properties of the components-i.e., those assumptions other components can make of a component, such as its provided services, performance characteristics, fault handling, shared resource usage, and so on (Bass et al., 1998). It also specifies the relationships among the components and how they interact. |
| **Conceptual Architecture** | The intent of the conceptual architecture is to direct attention at an appropriate decomposition of the system without delving into the details of interface specification and type information. Moreover, it provides a useful vehicle for communicating the architecture to non-technical audiences, such as management, marketing, and many users. The conceptual architecture identifies the system components, the responsibilities of each component, and interconnections between components. The structural choices are driven by the system qualities, and the rationale section articulates and documents this connection between the architectural requirements and the structures (components and connectors or communication/co-ordination mechanisms) of the architecture. |
| **Features** | Features are the differentiating functionality of a product. This functionality may not be available in other products, or it may not be available with the same quality characteristics. |
| **Functional Requirements** | Functional requirements capture the intended behavior of the system-or what the system will do. This behavior may be expressed as services, tasks or functions the system is required to perform. |
| **Logical Architecture** | The logical architecture is the detailed architecture specification, precisely defining the component interfaces and connection mechanisms and protocols. It is used by the component designers and developers. |
| **Meta-architecture** | The meta-architecture is a set of high-level decisions that will strongly influence the structure of the system, but is not itself the structure of the system. The meta-architecture, through style, patterns of composition or interaction, principles, and philosophy, rules certain structural choices out, and guides selection decisions and trade-offs among others. By choosing communication or co-ordination mechanisms that are repeatedly applied across the architecture, a consistent approach is ensured and this simplifies the architecture. (See [Bredemeyer Consulting](http://www.bredemeyer.com/howto.htm) and [Bredemeyer Consulting](http://www.bredemeyer.com/whatis.htm).) |
| **Non-functional Requirements** | Non-functional requirements or system qualities, capture required properties of the system, such as performance, security, maintainability, etc.-in other words, how well some behavioral or structural aspect of the system should be accomplished. |
| **Product Line** | Product lines consist of basically similar products with different cost/feature variations per product. |
| **Product Family** | Product families include a number of product lines targeted at somewhat different markets or usage situations. What makes the product lines part of a family, are some common elements of functionality and identity. |
| **Qualities** | System qualities, or non-functional requirements, capture required properties of the system, such as performance, security, maintainability, etc.-in other words, how well some behavioral or structural aspect of the system should be accomplished. |
| **Scenario** | A scenario is an instance of a use case, and represents a single path through the use case. Thus, one may construct a scenario for the main flow through the use case, and other scenarios for each possible variation of flow through the use case (e.g., triggered by error conditions, security breaches, etc.). Scenarios may be depicted using sequence diagrams. |
| **Use Case** | A use case defines a goal-oriented set of interactions between external actors and the system under consideration. That is, use cases capture who (actors) does what (interactions) with the system, for what purpose (goal). A complete set of use cases specifies all the different ways to use the system, and thus defines all behavior required of the system--without dealing with the internal structure of the system. |
| **Use Case Diagram** | A use case diagram is a graphical representation of the use cases and their relationships to the actors. |
| **User Interface** | The user interface is the part of the system with which the users interact. It includes all the screens, forms, reports, and so on that the users use to interact with the system. |
| **User Story** | A user story is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. |
| **View** | A view is a representation of a whole system from the perspective of a related set of concerns. Views are used to describe the system from the viewpoint of different stakeholders, such as end-users, developers, system engineers, and project managers. Views are used to describe the system from the viewpoint of different stakeholders, such as end-users, developers, system engineers, and project managers. |
| **Viewpoint** | A viewpoint is a specification of the conventions for constructing and using a view. A viewpoint specifies not only the kinds of models that are to be constructed, but also the rules governing the construction of those models. |
| **Viewtype** | A viewtype is a template for a view. It specifies the types of models that are to be constructed, and the rules governing the construction of those models. |
| **Work Product** | A work product is a document or model that is produced as part of a software development process. Work products are used to capture and communicate information about the system being developed. |
