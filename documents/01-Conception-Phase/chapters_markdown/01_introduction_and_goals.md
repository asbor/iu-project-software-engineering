# 1.1 Introduction And Goals

This document outlines the architecture and design of HoppyBrew, a web-based application for managing brewing recipes, brews, and batches. The application is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a clean and modern user interface. The application is also designed to be compatible with a wide range of devices and browsers, and to integrate with other brewing tools and services, such as `iSpindel`.

The top three quality goals for the architecture and design whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders of HoppyBrew have been identified as follows:

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="108"></th><th width="141"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Priority</strong></td><td><strong>Key word</strong></td><td><strong>Quality Goal</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Usability</td><td>The application should be easy to use and intuitive, with a clean and modern user interface.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Compatibility</td><td>The application should be compatible with a wide range of devices and browsers. (mobile, desktop, tablet)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Integration</td><td>The application should integrate with other brewing tools and services, such as <code>iSpindel</code>.</td></tr></tbody></table>

The motivation behind these goals are to ensure that the application is accessible to a wide range of users, and that it is easy to use and integrate with other brewing tools and services.

## 1.1 Requirements Overview

HoppyBrew is driven by the following essential features and functional requirements:

1. Manage and create brewing recipes
2. Manage and create brews and batches and log their progress
3. Monitor fermentation process with iSpindel integration
4. Manage inventory and generate shopping lists

The primary motivation behind HoppyBrew is to provide brewing enthusiasts (like myself) with a user-friendly platform for managing their brewing processes independently, without relying on subscription-based services.
