### Constraints

1. **Deadline:** Since this is just a school project, we've got a deadline we need to meet. We've only got a certain amount of time to finish everything, including planning how the project will work. This deadline is set based on how much credit the project is worth and how much work we expect it to take. For example, since this project is worth 5 credits, we think it'll take about 150 hours to complete.

2. **Feature Limitations:** Because it's a school project, we're going to leave out some parts of the application that aren't super important. For instance, we might not implement every single type of action for all the different parts of the app. If we can do one type of action for one part, we'll assume we can do it for all the others.

3. **User Interface Simplification:** To keep things simple, we'll make the user interface as basic as possible while still showing how the app works. This means it won't look super fancy or work perfectly on every device, but it'll get the job done. We won't spend too much time on making it look pretty because that's not the main focus of the project.

### Dependencies

The application is dependent on the following external services and tools:

1. **iSpindel:** The application is dependent on iSpindel for collecting realtime data.
2. **Database:** The application is dependent on a database for storing and managing data.
3. **GitHub:** The application is dependent on GitHub for version control and collaboration.
4. **Docker:** The application is dependent on Docker for containerization and deployment.
