# Solution Strategy

## Technology Decisions

The application will be encapsulated in a containerized environment using Docker. This will allow for easy deployment and scaling of the application, as well as ensuring consistency across different environments. The application will be developed using a microservices architecture, with each component of the application running as a separate service. This will allow for greater flexibility and scalability, as well as making it easier to maintain and update the application.

### Frontend Technology

After evaluating the requirements and constraints of the project, we have decided to use Vue.js as the frontend technology for the application. This is because Vue.js is a lightweight and flexible JavaScript framework that allows for rapid development of single-page applications. It provides a simple and intuitive syntax, making it easy to learn and use, which is ideal for a school project with a tight deadline. Additionally, Vue.js has a large and active community, which means there are plenty of resources and support available for developers. This will help us overcome any challenges we may face during the development process.
