# Runtime View

User interactions with the system are depicted in the following sequence diagrams.

## CRUD Recipe

The sequence diagram illustrates CRUD operations for the Recipe entity, showcasing the standard pattern for all CRUD operations. It starts with the Brewer creating a new Recipe, which is then stored in the database. Subsequently, the Brewer can perform actions such as retrieving, updating, and deleting the Recipe as required. Additionally, there's an option to list all Recipes stored in the database.

The Brewer interacts with the system via the Client Browser, initiating communication with the Cloudflare Tunnel. This tunnel then communicates with the HoppyBrew application. Within the HoppyBrew application, communication with the PostgreSQL database takes place for storing and retrieving data.

## CRUD Batch

A new Batch recipe is instantiated from an existing Recipe. The Brewer can then modify the Batch recipe as needed.

## Start Brew Process

The Brewer starts the brewing process by selecting a Batch recipe and starting the process. The ISpindel collects data from the brewing process and sends it to the system.
