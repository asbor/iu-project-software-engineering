# Architecture Decisions

## Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture

We have decided to use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for the application. The MVC architecture is a software design pattern that separates the application into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller. The model represents the data and business logic of the application, the view represents the user interface, and the controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. This separation of concerns helps to improve the maintainability, scalability, and testability of the application. It also allows for easier collaboration between developers, as each component can be developed independently.

## Microservices Architecture

We have decided to use a microservices architecture for the application. The microservices architecture is a software design pattern that decomposes the application into a set of small, independent services. Each service is responsible for a specific function or feature of the application, and communicates with other services using lightweight protocols such as HTTP or messaging. This separation of concerns helps to improve the scalability, flexibility, and maintainability of the application. It also allows for easier deployment and scaling of the application, as each service can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

## RESTful APIs

We have decided to use RESTful APIs for communication between the frontend and backend of the application. RESTful APIs are a set of architectural constraints that define how web services should be designed and implemented. They are based on the principles of statelessness, uniform interface, and resource-based architecture. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources, and use standard data formats such as JSON or XML to represent data. This makes it easy to develop, test, and maintain the APIs, as well as allowing for interoperability with other systems and services.

## Single Page Application (SPA)

We have decided to use a Single Page Application (SPA) for the frontend of the application. An SPA is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the application. This provides a more responsive and interactive user experience, as the page does not need to be reloaded every time the user performs an action. SPAs are also easier to develop and maintain, as they use a modular and component-based architecture. This allows for better code organization, reusability, and testability, as well as making it easier to scale and extend the application.

## Containerization

We have decided to use containerization for the deployment of the application. Containerization is a lightweight and portable technology that allows applications to be packaged into self-contained units called containers. Containers include everything needed to run the application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. This makes it easy to deploy and scale the application, as containers can run on any system that supports containerization. Containerization also provides isolation and security for the application, as each container runs in its own environment and does not interfere with other containers. This helps to ensure consistency and reliability across different environments, as well as making it easier to manage and update the application.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

We have decided to use Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for the development and deployment of the application. CI/CD is a set of practices and tools that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software. Continuous Integration involves automatically building and testing the code whenever changes are made, to ensure that the code is working correctly. Continuous Deployment involves automatically deploying the code to production whenever changes are made, to ensure that the code is available to users. This helps to improve the quality, speed, and reliability of the development process, as well as reducing the risk of errors and downtime. It also allows for faster feedback and iteration, as changes can be deployed quickly and easily.
