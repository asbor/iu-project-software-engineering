# Introduction and Goals

**This documentation:** is intended to provide a high-level overview of the HoppyBrew application. The document is based on the template provided by [@arc42]. Arc42 is a template for documenting software architectures. It is based on the ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 standard, which is the international standard for documenting software architectures. The template is designed to be flexible and adaptable, and to be used in a wide range of software development projects. The template is divided into a number of sections, each of which covers a different aspect of the software architecture. The sections are designed to be used in a modular fashion, so that they can be used individually or in combination with other sections. The template is also designed to be easy to use, with a clear and consistent structure, and with a focus on the most important aspects of software architecture.

**HoppyBrew:** is a web application for managing brewing recipes and brew logs. The general idea of the application is to provide a user-friendly and intuitive interface for managing brewing recipes and brew logs. The application is designed to be compatible with a wide range of devices and browsers, and to integrate with other brewing tools and services, such as `iSpindel`. The application is targeted at beer brewer enthusiasts who want a high-quality, open-source application that is easy to maintain and extend.

Note! The terminology `brew` and `batch` are used interchangeably in this document to refer to the same thing, i.e.Â a single brewing process.

## Quality Goals

The top three quality goals for the architecture and design whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders of HoppyBrew have been identified as follows:

| **Priority** | **Key word**  | **Quality Goal** |
| - | - | ----- |
| 1 | Usability | The application should be easy to use and intuitive, with a clean and modern user interface. |
| 2 | Compatibility | The application should be compatible with a wide range of devices and browsers. (mobile, desktop, tablet) |
| 3 | Integration | The application should integrate with other brewing tools and services, such as `iSpindel`. |

Table: Quality goals and priorities for the application.

The motivation behind these goals are to ensure that the application lives up to the expectations of the most important stakeholders, since they are the ones who will be the ones who influence the fundamental architecture and design decisions.

## Stakeholders

In the architecture and design process of HoppyBrew, stakeholders play a pivotal role, providing essential requirements and constraints. Given that this project is part of a school assignment, the stakeholders are limited to the following individuals and their expectations:

| **Priority** | **Name/Category** | **Expectations** |
| - | -- | --- |
| **Primary** | Beer-brewer Enthusiast | Wants a user-friendly and intuitive application for managing brewing recipes and brew logs. |
| **Secondary** | Self-hosting Enthusiast and devellopers | Wants a high-quality, open-source application that is easy to maintain and extend. |

Table: Stakeholders and their expectations for the application.

## Requirements Overview

The requirements for the HoppyBrew application are based on the following use cases:
