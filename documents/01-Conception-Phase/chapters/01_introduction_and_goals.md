# Introduction and Goals

## Conceptual Architecture Documentation for the HoppyBrew application.

**This documentation:** is intended to provide a high-level overview of the HoppyBrew application. The document is based on the template provided by [@arc42]. Arc42 is a template for documenting software architectures. It is based on the ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 standard, which is the international standard for documenting software architectures. The template is designed to be flexible and adaptable, and to be used in a wide range of software development projects. The template is divided into a number of sections, each of which covers a different aspect of the software architecture. The sections are designed to be used in a modular fashion, so that they can be used individually or in combination with other sections. The template is also designed to be easy to use, with a clear and consistent structure, and with a focus on the most important aspects of software architecture.

**HoppyBrew:** is a web application for managing brewing recipes and brew logs. The general idea of the application is to provide a user-friendly and intuitive interface for managing brewing recipes and brew logs. The application is designed to be compatible with a wide range of devices and browsers, and to integrate with other brewing tools and services, such as `iSpindel`. The application is targeted at beer brewer enthusiasts who want to manage their brewing recipes and brew logs in a simple and efficient way without the need for overpriced subscriptions fees like at [@Brewfather], [@BrewersFriend]  or [@BeerSmith].

Note! The terminology `brew` and `batch` are used interchangeably in this document to refer to the same thing, i.e. a single brewing process.

## Quality Goals

The top three quality goals for the architecture and design whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders of HoppyBrew have been identified as follows:

| **Priority** | **Key word**  | **Quality Goal** |
| - | - | ----- |
| 1 | Usability | The application should be easy to use and intuitive, with a clean and modern user interface. |
| 2 | Compatibility | The application should be compatible with a wide range of devices and browsers. (mobile, desktop, tablet) |
| 3 | Integration | The application should integrate with other brewing tools and services, such as `iSpindel`. |

Table: Quality goals and priorities for the application.

These quality goals are based on derived summaries of `ISO/IEC 25010 quality model` provided in the lecture. The quality goals are derived from the most important stakeholders' expectations for the application. The quality goals are intended to provide a high-level overview of the most important quality attributes for the application, and to guide the architecture and design process in a way that ensures that these quality attributes are met.

The motivation behind these goals are to ensure that the application lives up to the expectations of the most important stakeholders, since they are the ones who will be the ones who influence the fundamental architecture and design decisions.

## Stakeholders

In the architecture and design process of HoppyBrew, stakeholders play a pivotal role, providing essential requirements and constraints. Given that this project is part of a school assignment, the stakeholders are limited to the following individuals and their expectations:

| **Priority** | **Name/Category** | **Expectations** |
| - | -- | --- |
| **Primary** | Beer-brewer Enthusiast | Wants a user-friendly and intuitive application for managing brewing recipes and brew logs. |
| **Secondary** | Self-hosting Enthusiast and devellopers | Wants a high-quality, open-source application that is easy to maintain and extend. |
| **Tertiary** | The Software Architect | Wants a well-documented and well-structured application that meets the requirements of the assignment. On sucessful completion of the project, the Architect will be engolfed in a sense of pride and accomplishment. |

Table: Stakeholders and their expectations for the application.

It's important to recognize that since this is just a school project, the stakeholders are restricted to my own different personas.

## Requirements Overview

The purpose of this section is to provide a high-level overview of the requirements for the application. The requirements are divided into two categories: functional requirements and non-functional requirements.

After having spiraled through how to structure the requirement section, I have come to see that there are two main ways to structure the requirements section. The first way is to structure the requirements section based on the use cases that have been identified for the application. The second way is to structure the requirements section based on the requirements provided by the stakeholders. The first way is more focused on the functionality of the application, while the second way is more focused on the expectations of the stakeholders.

So what what exactly is the difference between the two approaches one might ask?

> *"Functional requirements and use cases differ in several aspects, such as their level of detail, abstraction, and scope. Functional requirements tend to be more detailed, specific, and precise, while use cases tend to be more abstract, general, and flexible. Functional requirements focus on the system's functionality and behavior, while use cases focus on the user's goals and needs. Functional requirements cover the entire system and all its features, while use cases cover only a subset of the system and its functions."* [@linkedinSolutionArchetecture]

In this document, I have chosen to reduce the concept of use cases to a single High-level use case diagram, and then focus on the functional requirements that are derived from the use cases. The reason for this is because the overall design of the application is relatively simple.

### High-level Use Cases

The following use cases have been identified for the application:

### Functional Requirements

The functional requirements for the application are based on the use cases that have been identified for the application. The use cases are intended to provide a high-level overview of the functionality that the application should support. The use cases are based on the requirements provided by the stakeholders and are intended to guide the architecture and design process in a way that ensures that the application meets the expectations of the stakeholders.

It is important to note that the difference between a use case and a functional requirement is that a use case describes a specific interaction between a user and the system, while a functional requirement describes a specific function or feature that the system should support. And although the use cases are based on the requirements provided by the stakeholders, the functional requirements are based on the use cases. Which means that the functional requirements are taking a step further and are more detailed than the use cases.

The functional requirements for the application are as follows:

| Id | Requirement | Description |
| - | -- | ---- |
| **FR1** | **User Management** | The application should support CRUD operations for users. |
| **FR2** | **Recipe Management** | The application should support CRUD operations for recipes. |

> **Note!**
>
> - Requirements indicated with `{}` are abstract requirements that are further detailed in their respective sub-requirements.
>
> - CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

### Non-functional Requirements

The non-functional requirements for the application are based on the quality goals that have been identified for the application. The quality goals are intended to provide a high-level overview of the most important quality attributes for the application, and to guide the architecture and design process in a way that ensures that these quality attributes are met. Unlike the functional requirements, the non-functional requirements not always so easily measurable, and are often more subjective in nature.

The non-functional requirements for the application are as follows:

| Id | Requirement | Description |
| - | -- | ---- |
| **NFR1** | **Usability** | The application should be easy to use and intuitive, with a clean and modern user interface. |

## Architecture Constraints

### Assumptions

When starting a new project, we often rely on certain assumptions based on the information we have at the time. Here are the assumptions we've made for this application:

1. **Online Learning:** We assume that any missing knowledge can be gained through online resources and documentation. This means we believe we can learn what we need to know about the technologies used in the project without too much difficulty, and in a reasonable amount of time.
