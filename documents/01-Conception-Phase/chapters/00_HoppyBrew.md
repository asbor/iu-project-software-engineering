abstract: The project aims to develop a comprehensive Beer Brewing Recipe Manager system, catering to brewing enthusiasts and homebrewers. This system facilitates the management of brewing processes and associated data through intuitive interfaces and robust functionalities. Users can create, share, and manage beer recipes, customize water and equipment profiles, schedule brewing sessions, monitor fermentation in real-time, generate reports, and more. The system ensures a seamless user experience by integrating with external devices like ISpindel for data collection and leveraging a database for secure storage and retrieval of brewing-related information. With an emphasis on user-friendly design and versatile features, the Beer Brewing Recipe Manager fosters innovation and tradition in the art of homebrewing.
