### What did I do today?

* Built the overall documentation structure.
* Created placeholders for the chapters in the Conception Phase.
* Created makefile to build the documentation as pdf and markdown files.
* Created the first development journal entry.

### Which challenges did I encounter?

* My previous makefile failed to function as intended, necessitating a complete rewrite from the ground up. Additionally, the conventional method of executing make pdf proved ineffective, prompting a complete overhaul of my approach. The revised strategy now employs Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('documents/01-Conception-Phase.md', output\_format = 'pdf\_document')".

### What did I learn?

* I have expanded my knowledge of the `markdown` language.
* I have expanded my knowledge of the `make` tool and its shotcomings.

### What are the tasks for tomorrow?

* I will review the lecture slides and take notes.
* I will start working on the first assignment.
