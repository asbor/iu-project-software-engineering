### What did I do today?

* Understanding UML remains incredibly frustrating. It's excessively vague and hindered by its extensive history, resulting in countless resources that don't align with the latest standard, UML 2.5. After scouring through numerous documentation sources, I stumbled upon [https://www.uml-diagrams.org/](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/), which thankfully presents the most up-to-date information. It's a resource I had previously overlooked.

### Which challenges did I encounter?

1. PlantUML is a powerful tool, but it's not without its flaws. The syntax is incredibly finicky, and the documentation is lacking. I've had to rely on trial and error to understand how to use it effectively.
2. Enterprise Architect is a powerful tool, which comes with a comprehensive documentation related to the UML standard, and how to implement it in the application. However, the tool comes with a steep learning curve, and I've had to spend a considerable amount of time to remember how to use it. Although the application comes with a comprehensive documentation, i am not convinced that it is completely in line with the UML 2.5 standard.

### What did I learn?

* We do not have license for Enterprise Architect, and as i wanted to use it in trial mode, the images generated by the application are watermarked. making it very reluctant to use it in the documentation. I am considering to use PlantUML, but due to its syntax, i am not sure if it is the best option.

### What are the tasks for tomorrow?

* I will continue to work on the UML diagrams, and try to find a way to make PlantUML work for me.
